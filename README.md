Initially designed to allow Neutrinite DAO to manage its treasury

From Neutrinite DAO Roadmap:
2.9. â€˜Swapperâ€™ Protocol for Atomic Token Swapping 
'Swapper' â€“ a streamlined protocol designed for the atomic swapping of tokens between various parties. This innovative feature is set to enhance the exchange capabilities within our ecosystem significantly. 
Key Aspects of Swapper: 
1. Simplified Token Exchange: Swapper will facilitate a straightforward and efficient process for exchanging tokens, removing the complexities often associated with such transactions. 
2. Atomic Swaps: The protocol ensures atomicity, meaning the transactions will be executed in their entirety or not at all, thereby safeguarding against partial or failed exchanges. 
3. Empowering DAOs and Contracts: While Swapper is not a full-fledged DEX, it opens up novel avenues for DAOs and smart contracts to interact and trade with each other.


The design of this 4th gen was modified. (Atomic Swaps) no longer possible with the new architecture.
